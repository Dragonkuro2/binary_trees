# 0x1D C - Binary trees :pencil2:

## Introduction

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language known for its versatility. This project focuses on binary trees and covers various concepts related to them. Special thanks to [Aissam Abakkar](https://github.com/Aissamab) for contributing to this project!

## Project Goals

By the end of this project, we aimed to understand the following questions:

- What is a binary tree?
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
- What are the depth, the height, and the size of a binary tree?
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
- What is a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree?

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
### Task 0: Function that creates a binary tree node
### Task 1 : Function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
### Task 2 : Function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
### Task 3 : Function that deletes an entire binary tree
### Task 4 : Function that checks if a node is a leaf
### Task 5 : Function that checks if a given node is a root
### Task 6 : Function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
### Task 7 : Function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
### Task 8 : Function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
### Task 9 : Function that measures the height of a binary tree
### Task 10 : Function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
### Task 11 : Function that measures the size of a binary tree
### Task 12 : Function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
### Task 13 : Function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
### Task 14 : Function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
### Task 15 : Function that checks if a binary tree is full
### Task 16 : Function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
### Task 17 : Function that finds the sibling of a node
### Task 18 : Function that finds the uncle of a node
